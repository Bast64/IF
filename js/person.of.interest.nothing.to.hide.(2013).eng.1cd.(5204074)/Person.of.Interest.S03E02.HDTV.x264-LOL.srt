1
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:03,450
You are being watched.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,400
The government has
a secret system--

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:10,340
a machine that spies on
you every hour of every day.

4
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:13,580
I designed the machine
to detect acts of terror

5
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:15,010
but it sees
everything--

6
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,030
violent crimes involving
ordinary people.

7
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,540
The government considered
these people irrelevant.

8
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:22,700
We don't.

9
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:27,830
Hunted by the authorities,
we work in secret.

10
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,850
You'll never find us.

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,320
But victim or perpetrator,

12
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,380
if your number's
up, we'll find you.

13
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:45,245
Everything's in place.

14
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,300
Good, let's begin.

15
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,410
He does that.

16
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,050
The man likes his privacy.

17
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:29,400
You can't blame a girl for trying.

18
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,160
It's for you.

19
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:40,080
Good morning, Ms. Shaw.

20
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,440
Morning.

21
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:43,290
Beautiful day for a walk.

22
00:01:43,325 --> 00:01:44,415
I suppose.

23
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:46,870
When you finish yours, could
you join us back at the library?

24
00:01:46,905 --> 00:01:48,340
We have another number.

25
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:19,180
Detective Carter, right?

26
00:02:19,215 --> 00:02:21,090
Office actually.

27
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:22,960
Alonzo Quinn.

28
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:25,755
Cal's Godfather, of course.

29
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:27,730
I remember you from the funeral.

30
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:30,150
Your eulogy was beautiful.

31
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:33,330
Wasn't hard to find beautiful
things to say about Cal.

32
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,335
Chief was keeping me
apprised of his case.

33
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:40,670
Says they're looking at a couple
of Carl Elias' men as the shooters.

34
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,980
Yes, heard that too.

35
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:44,640
You think otherwise?

36
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,130
Not sure. But I think
there is more to than that.

37
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,265
My shift is about start.

38
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,620
Don't let me hold you up. It's
nice seeing you again, Office.

39
00:02:57,655 --> 00:02:59,330
Me too. Take care.

40
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,500
It's me.

41
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,970
I think we might still have
a problem with Office Carter.

42
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,460
What's up?

43
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,230
Looking for news on Cal's case.

44
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,650
I haven't heard any.

45
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,455
What about in the database?

46
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:27,340
- Carter...
- Look, I'd check myself,

47
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:29,155
but you know they pulled my access.

48
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,885
Yes, they will pull
mine too if they catch me

49
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,580
poking around a case
I'm not assigned to.

50
00:03:32,615 --> 00:03:34,480
Come on, it's important.

51
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,500
Ok. When it clears out a little.

52
00:03:38,535 --> 00:03:39,810
Thanks, Fusco.

53
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,370
I've got our number, Finch.

54
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,285
What do you know about this guy?

55
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:57,600
Wayne Kruger, 43, married,
Internet entrepreneur,

56
00:03:57,635 --> 00:04:01,160
and founder of a company
called "LifeTrace".

57
00:04:01,195 --> 00:04:02,535
And what's their business?

58
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:06,240
They marketed themselves as
a "People Search" service,

59
00:04:06,275 --> 00:04:09,910
where their users can look
up old friends or relatives

60
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,850
anyone they've fallen
out of touch with.

61
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:13,375
Sounds harmless enough.

62
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:16,180
There is, however,
more to it than that.

63
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:17,530
Always is.

64
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:20,790
Their business isn't really
about reconnecting people,

65
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,760
it's about collecting and
selling their information.

66
00:04:24,795 --> 00:04:26,680
He's a data broker.

67
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:28,205
What kind of data?

68
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,560
Anything you would ever
wanna know about a person

69
00:04:30,595 --> 00:04:33,365
where they live, work, shop, eat,

70
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,075
how much they earn,
how they vote and more.

71
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:40,540
Then he turns around and sells the
information to businesses, individuals

72
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,750
even the government.

73
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,705
Is that legal?

74
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:46,320
Technically, data brokers get their
information from public records,

75
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:49,630
but also from the ways people
reveal themselves online

76
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:51,510
whether they're aware
or whether they're not.

77
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,650
Sounds a little like your machine.

78
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:57,575
A principle difference would be

79
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:00,520
that the machine never
reveals any of its information

80
00:05:00,555 --> 00:05:02,482
beyond the social security number.

81
00:05:02,517 --> 00:05:04,375
So you're not a fan of Kruger's.

82
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:05,315
People like him are
one of the reasons

83
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:09,060
I made sure the machine
was impenetrable black box.

84
00:05:09,095 --> 00:05:10,860
Kruger's just entered his building.

85
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:12,735
He's in Shaw's hands now.

86
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,980
I hope sending her in
there was a good decision.

87
00:05:15,015 --> 00:05:17,285
You doubt her ability
to be discreet?

88
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,820
I doubt her ability to
keep from shooting someone?

89
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,820
I'm in, Finch.

90
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,820
Kruger's got some kind
of big shot meeting.

91
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,590
Gentlemen, we're thrilled
that you're considering us.

92
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:55,955
We know that Riverton
is a huge retailer

93
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:58,090
and that you've got your pick
of potential data partners.

94
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:00,965
We've done
our homework--

95
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,345
or rather peter has
done our homework, and

96
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:07,920
he says you're one of the
companies we should consider.

97
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:10,140
I've looked at all the
information you provided,

98
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:12,485
including the company
profile, growth rate,

99
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:16,320
consumer analytic statistics,
and data points per target--

100
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:18,010
Congratulations.

101
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:30,950
Any problems with
your cover, Ms. Shaw?

102
00:06:30,985 --> 00:06:32,990
Not unless someone asks me to type.

103
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,560
A baby rattle?

104
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:43,355
I apologize if I
spoiled the surprise.

105
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:47,085
No, it's all right,
it's just, my wife and I

106
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,400
haven't told anybody
outside the immediate family.

107
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:53,545
- How did you know?
- Your wine consumption.

108
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,590
- Excuse me?
- It's dropped from two bottles a week

109
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,115
to almost nothing in
the past three months,

110
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,870
And your milk, yogurt, and
cheese consumption has tripled.

111
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,395
The grocery store where you shop.

112
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:06,460
You're members of their
customer loyalty program.

113
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,250
We created that.

114
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:12,000
And I thought they
just sent out coupons.

115
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,965
No. Programs like that

116
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,055
are just scratching the
surface of what we can do.

117
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:20,110
What we're really working
towards here at LifeTrace

118
00:07:20,145 --> 00:07:21,165
is the future,

119
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,460
A future where every
person's needs will be met

120
00:07:23,495 --> 00:07:25,720
because we have all the
information necessary

121
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:27,480
to meet those needs.

122
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:31,160
Eating habits to predict diseases.

123
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:34,795
Compatibility factors
to eliminate loneliness.

124
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,290
And the way we do that is
by getting to know someone,

125
00:07:37,325 --> 00:07:40,080
from the major
events of their lives,

126
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:43,220
right down to the tiniest
detail of their everyday routine.

127
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:45,725
Learning everything about a person

128
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,870
allows us to help them
improve their life.

129
00:07:48,905 --> 00:07:50,325
Sounds appealing, but can I ask,

130
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,540
have you run into any issues
with respect to privacy concerns?

131
00:07:53,575 --> 00:07:55,215
Nothing significant.

132
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,515
There are always a few who
take issue with what we do,

133
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:02,350
but these days, people know,
you can't fight the technology.

134
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:07,330
And let's be honest, those
crying the loudest about privacy

135
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:10,280
are probably the ones
trying to hide something.

136
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:12,705
That's why--
uh, Barry.

137
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:17,450
- Oh, yeah.
- That's why I put my own profile up on our site.

138
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:22,100
Anyone can look me up and
see, I've got nothing to hide.

139
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:30,740
We'll need to work out a
proposal to present to our board.

140
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,470
How would tomorrow
morning work for you?

141
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:35,240
Sounds great.

142
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,465
Yes, it'll be all
their numbers--

143
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,810
Whatever's going on with this guy,

144
00:08:43,845 --> 00:08:45,085
it sure isn't hurting his business.

145
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,030
I think it's time to look a
little more closely at Mr. Kruger.

146
00:08:48,065 --> 00:08:50,940
People who say they have
nothing to hide almost always do.

147
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,030
Nothing comes up on his record.

148
00:09:03,065 --> 00:09:05,480
Thank you for checking.

149
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:07,600
I understand you're
back on the day shift.

150
00:09:07,635 --> 00:09:09,530
Yeah, but I'm giving up something

151
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,440
What's that?

152
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:13,090
My patience.

153
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:14,320
Good morning.

154
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,810
We'll see.

155
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,045
Before we roll, I just want to say

156
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,720
I'm really looking forward
to working together and--

157
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,300
Laskey,

158
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:27,340
one, I didn't want to be an F.T.O.,

159
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:29,060
but it beats being a vampire.

160
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,960
Number two,

161
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:34,090
When I tell you to do something,
just you do it, no questions.

162
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:36,060
And number three,

163
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:38,880
Don't touch my radio. Got it?

164
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:40,420
Yes, Ma'am.

165
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:43,460
Carter. Just Carter.

166
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,215
How is it I got stuck
being the office monkey?

167
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:55,520
I thought you liked being in
the middle of the action, Shaw.

168
00:09:55,555 --> 00:09:57,680
I think I'd see more
action in a tollbooth.

169
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,280
I was just emptying the trash.

170
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,460
No problem.

171
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,155
- I'll come back.
- Okay.

172
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,490
Tell the board we're
meeting tomorrow.

173
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:11,000
Sure thing, Mr. Kruger.

174
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:14,090
Quite a stunt you pulled
with the baby rattle.

175
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:15,745
I'd have told you about it,

176
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,550
but you'd have tried
to talk me out of it.

177
00:10:18,585 --> 00:10:20,995
You're right. We need this deal.

178
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:22,415
Well, we just got
it. Come on, Barry.

179
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:25,930
This changes everything.
This puts us on the map.

180
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,465
What is it, Haley?

181
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,375
It's about the party tonight.

182
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:30,550
I tried to put the restaurant
deposit on your credit card

183
00:10:30,585 --> 00:10:31,920
but it was declined.

184
00:10:31,955 --> 00:10:33,085
What? Why?

185
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,650
I don't know, the bank
wouldn't tell me, I'm sorry.

186
00:10:35,685 --> 00:10:36,660
I'll handle it.

187
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:43,075
You know, sometimes, I
wish I had an assistant

188
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:46,870
whose qualifications extended
beyond having a great ass.

189
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,400
I sure hope this
guy's a perpetrator.

190
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:51,740
Want to go to a party, Shaw?

191
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:54,270
Only if you promise to
wear something pretty.

192
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,540
Thanks. You.

193
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:23,145
First, I want to say
it's great of all of you

194
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:26,860
to make it tonight,
especially my wife Dedee.

195
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,100
Mr. Reese, how's
the Kruger's party?

196
00:11:31,135 --> 00:11:32,375
Delightful.

197
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:33,575
Have you learned anything?

198
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,840
Just that Kruger's
got a lot of friends,

199
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:38,170
appears to be happily married,

200
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:42,500
and Shaw likes truffled quail eggs.

201
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,870
You can't expect me to shoot
somebody on an empty stomach.

202
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:48,020
I'd prefer you didn't
shoot anyone at all.

203
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,440
What about you,
Finch? Dig anything up?

204
00:11:50,475 --> 00:11:53,375
Yes. Kruger's gone to great lengths

205
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:56,580
to suppress any bad
publicity about LifeTrace.

206
00:11:56,615 --> 00:12:00,630
Negative blog posts, news articles,

207
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,020
Even a class action lawsuit buried
in non-disclosure agreements,

208
00:12:05,055 --> 00:12:07,280
All scrubbed from the internet.

209
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,790
Sweetheart, I love
you. This is for you.

210
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,435
I've got nothing to hide.

211
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:02,050
I've got nothing to hide.

212
00:13:02,085 --> 00:13:03,630
I've got nothing to hide.

213
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,350
Turn it off. Turn it off, now!

214
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,840
Turn it off!

215
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:13,680
This somebody's idea of a joke?

216
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:18,650
Dedee, honey,
I have no id--

217
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:20,865
Mr. Reese?

218
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:24,500
Yeah, someone just turned Kruger's
anniversary video into a sex tape.

219
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:25,560
Oh, my.

220
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:28,290
Sweetie,
listen--

221
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,000
What are you all looking at?

222
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,140
Go home. The party's over.

223
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,700
Party's over!

224
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,735
Just when things were
getting interesting.

225
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:52,785
I know, first his
credit cards, now this.

226
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,800
Someone's messing
with Kruger, Finch.

227
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:56,855
The machine wouldn't
send us his number

228
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:58,775
if someone just wanted
to humiliate him.

229
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:00,660
No, we need to find
whoever's behind this

230
00:14:00,695 --> 00:14:02,440
before they come after him again.

231
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,310
Or before Kruger finds them first.

232
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,425
- Finch.
- Ms. Shaw. Is everything all right?

233
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:31,120
Don't sound so worried, Harold.
I haven't hurt anybody...yet.

234
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:32,825
Very reassuring. You have news?

235
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:35,255
I think I know who hijacked
Kruger's anniversary party.

236
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:37,870
Here's the restaurant's security
camera footage from last night.

237
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,580
A woman dressed as a waiter.

238
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,420
None of the waitstaff
had seen her before.

239
00:14:44,455 --> 00:14:45,650
I might have.

240
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,695
I've been going
through all the parties

241
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:49,450
to the class action
suit against Kruger.

242
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,515
All of them claim to
have been victimized

243
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:54,790
when their personal information
was released by LifeTrace.

244
00:14:54,825 --> 00:14:55,935
Victimized how?

245
00:14:55,970 --> 00:15:00,240
Identity theft, harassment,
blackmail, fraud.

246
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:01,940
Even murder.

247
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:02,800
Who?

248
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,495
Chloe Harper,

249
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:06,690
Daughter of the lead
plaintiff, Sherry Harper.

250
00:15:06,725 --> 00:15:08,035
She lost her life to a stalker,

251
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:10,540
who found her home
address using LifeTrace.

252
00:15:10,575 --> 00:15:12,502
No wonder Kruger
wanted the suit buried.

253
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:14,430
Detective Fusco is
running background checks

254
00:15:14,465 --> 00:15:16,570
on all of the
plaintiffs as we speak.

255
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,895
Wait, I just found
our mystery waiter.

256
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:21,240
Her name is Karen Mills.
She lives in Queens.

257
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:22,430
I'm on my way.

258
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,815
No, stay put, Ms. Shaw.

259
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:26,060
I'll see if Detective
Carter can help us.

260
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,920
- What did she do?
- Rolled a stop.

261
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,430
Really?

262
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:48,840
Stay in the car. I got this.

263
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,280
License and registration, please.

264
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,310
Something wrong, Officer?

265
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,320
You could say that.

266
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,970
Why are you coming
after Wayne Kruger?

267
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,650
Don't make me ask twice, Ms. Mills.

268
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,270
I-I got a package.

269
00:16:23,305 --> 00:16:25,060
A package? From who?

270
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,510
I don't know.

271
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:28,810
It was anonymous.

272
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,055
There was a DVD and
some instructions

273
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,150
on what to do if I
wanted to get back at him.

274
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:35,180
Why? What did he do to you?

275
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:37,960
He ruined my life.

276
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,750
How?

277
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,750
I was a paralegal at a law firm.

278
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,330
It's where I met my fiance.

279
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,965
One day, some of
the assistants were

280
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,780
looking people up on
this website, LifeTrace.

281
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:59,370
They found some pictures.

282
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:01,120
What kind of pictures?

283
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:06,260
They were taken
by an ex-boyfriend,

284
00:17:06,295 --> 00:17:09,150
of us, in his bedroom.

285
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,850
And everyone saw them.

286
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:14,720
My fiance, he...

287
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,550
called off our engagement.

288
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,460
When I got the package,

289
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,330
I saw a chance to make Kruger

290
00:17:25,365 --> 00:17:27,260
feel the humiliation that I felt.

291
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:29,800
So I took it.

292
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:35,830
Okay.

293
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:40,170
I'm gonna let you off with a
warning this time, Ms. Mills.

294
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:44,230
So long as you take
that package you got

295
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:47,890
take it to a Detective Lionel
Fusco at the 8th precinct,

296
00:17:47,925 --> 00:17:51,030
and you promise me you'll never
do anything like that again.

297
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,220
Thank you. I won't, Officer.

298
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:58,520
Good, 'cause the NYPD, we'll know.

299
00:17:58,610 --> 00:17:59,670
Trust me.

300
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:08,570
Hope you got that.

301
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:09,910
Mr. Reese?

302
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:11,000
I heard.

303
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,190
Doesn't sound like
she had anything to do

304
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,870
with the other attacks on Kruger.

305
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:17,600
Likely done by whoever
sent the anonymous package.

306
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:21,685
Look, baby, I know you're mad,

307
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,245
but I need you to call me back.

308
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,980
The bank says our
cards have been canceled

309
00:18:25,015 --> 00:18:26,907
and our account's emptied out.

310
00:18:26,942 --> 00:18:28,800
Something's wrong. Just call me.

311
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:31,290
Haley, will you get my
accountant on the line?

312
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:33,750
What are you doing?
What's the problem?

313
00:18:33,785 --> 00:18:34,950
My problem?

314
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,660
First saved message.

315
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:39,335
You know, sometimes, I
wish I had an assistant

316
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:42,990
whose qualifications extended
beyond having a great ass.

317
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:45,860
- Where did that come from?
- You, apparently.

318
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:48,480
Someone is using Kruger's
own words against him.

319
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:50,220
His office must be bugged.

320
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,100
Screw you, Wayne.

321
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:01,200
Mr. Hayes?

322
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,150
Mr. Collier.

323
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:08,650
Mr. Collier, what's going on?

324
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,410
In light of recent developments,

325
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:14,885
Mr. Deaver doesn't think LifeTrace

326
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,870
is the best partner
for us, after all.

327
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:18,710
Excuse me.

328
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:25,240
This is getting
better by the minute.

329
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:28,070
What the hell happened?

330
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:29,710
I was hoping you could tell me.

331
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:37,675
No. No, no, no. You
gotta take the site down.

332
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:40,990
We already did, but not
before Riverton saw it.

333
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,750
They yanked the deal!

334
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:45,120
I cannot believe this is happening!

335
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:47,895
You never said you went
bankrupt, or had a DUI.

336
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:50,660
That was over ten years
ago. It was expunged.

337
00:19:50,695 --> 00:19:51,970
Is this an arrest warrant?

338
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,875
I was in college. It was dismissed.

339
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:56,280
Look, this is all ancient history.

340
00:19:56,315 --> 00:19:58,615
It's new to us, and to Riverton.

341
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:00,730
Someone is screwing with
me. Can't you see that?

342
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,530
Wayne, we think it
might be best if you...

343
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:08,550
took some time to sort
out your personal issues.

344
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:12,015
If I took some time?

345
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:15,270
A leave of absence while
we evaluate our options.

346
00:20:15,305 --> 00:20:17,070
While you evaluate your options?

347
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,705
This is my company, Barry!

348
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:23,390
And you're the face of it.
And that's now a problem.

349
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,150
Okay,
look--

350
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,080
We already took a vote.

351
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:39,580
Fine. Fine.

352
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:44,010
But I'm gonna find out
who's doing this to me.

353
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:47,070
And then, I'm gonna call Riverton.

354
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:49,920
I'm gonna fix this.

355
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:54,300
Looks like Kruger's just been
kicked out of his own company.

356
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,700
Things are escalating
with Kruger, Finch.

357
00:20:57,410 --> 00:20:59,450
We any closer to
finding the perpetrator?

358
00:20:59,485 --> 00:21:00,940
I'm working on it, Mr. Reese.

359
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,380
Hello.

360
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,495
You've hurt a great many people,

361
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:25,570
- Mr. Kruger.
- What? Who is this?

362
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:27,730
You need to understand.

363
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,940
Understand what?

364
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,290
You listen to me. If I find
out you're the one responsible--

365
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:45,775
The elevator's free falling.

366
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:48,040
Modern elevators do
not freefall, Ms. Shaw.

367
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:49,360
Tell that to Kruger.

368
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,510
You can't fight the technology.

369
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,940
Somebody has disabled
the auto-safety features.

370
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:01,900
The elevators aren't
networked. I can't access them.

371
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:50,840
Kruger made it out, Finch.

372
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,580
Whoever's coming after
him has taken his company,

373
00:22:53,615 --> 00:22:55,880
his money, his marriage.

374
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,400
Soon the only thing left
to take will be his life.

375
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:13,920
Finch, the call he
got in the elevator,

376
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:15,180
could you trace it?

377
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:17,705
No, but whoever
hijacked the elevator

378
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:20,460
would have needed access to
the building's electrical room.

379
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:23,750
I do know who cleaned out
Kruger's bank accounts.

380
00:23:23,785 --> 00:23:25,835
- Who?
- Dennis Paulson.

381
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:28,480
Detective Fusco got his
photo off the phony ID.

382
00:23:28,515 --> 00:23:31,550
He used to cash out
Kruger's accounts.

383
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:35,990
He's another member of the
class action suit against Kruger,

384
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,040
same as Ms. Mills.

385
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,570
Then we're looking at
multiple perpetrators.

386
00:23:40,605 --> 00:23:43,627
Yes. Paulson lost his
job and was arrested

387
00:23:43,662 --> 00:23:46,615
after LifeTrace
conflated his profile with

388
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:49,470
that of a serial rapist who
happened to have the same name.

389
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:51,450
Hate it when that happens.

390
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:56,565
Paulson told Fusco he'd
received the fake ID.

391
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,930
and Kruger's banking information
in an anonymous package.

392
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:02,415
Same as Karen Mills.

393
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:03,950
Someone's giving these
victims everything

394
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,500
they need to get back at Kruger.

395
00:24:05,535 --> 00:24:07,445
It's turnkey revenge.

396
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,855
How many people in
that class action?

397
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:12,230
Over 200. 23 in
the tri-state area.

398
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,940
Finch, we can't stop that many.

399
00:24:13,975 --> 00:24:15,300
It'd be fun trying.

400
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,555
I gotta ask, though, is
this guy even worth our time?

401
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:21,140
You know, that's not a question
we entertained when we saved you,

402
00:24:21,175 --> 00:24:22,060
Ms. Shaw.

403
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:26,200
Our only chance to save
Kruger is to find him.

404
00:24:26,235 --> 00:24:28,160
I'm sending you his coordinates.

405
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:39,370
Guy's a member of
the Northside Killas.

406
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:41,310
Dang, got shot up pretty bad.

407
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,370
Who do you think did this?

408
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,640
Hard to say.

409
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,190
I'd talk to his
regular customers first,

410
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,600
see who he was
having problems with.

411
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:52,955
But that's not our job.

412
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:56,430
We just secure the scene
and take the statements.

413
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:57,920
Right.

414
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:01,310
First body?

415
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:03,280
Yeah.

416
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:06,270
You okay?

417
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,540
Yeah, fine.

418
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:15,250
Rookies.

419
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:24,810
I don't know what happened.

420
00:25:24,845 --> 00:25:27,150
No? Take a look at your shoes.

421
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:30,660
Just suck on the ice.

422
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,555
You find anything?

423
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:38,170
I haven't looked yet. Hang on.

424
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:47,920
Let's see.

425
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:52,930
What is it?

426
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,740
The file's been frozen.

427
00:25:54,775 --> 00:25:55,945
What? Why?

428
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:59,410
Why do you think? Probably
too many prying eyes.

429
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,325
I'm feeling a little better,

430
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,220
so if you want to
get back to it--

431
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,900
Yeah, sure. Let's go.

432
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,840
Okay, Finch, I've got him.

433
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,210
Mr. Collier, it's
Wayne Kruger again.

434
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:29,070
I'm really hoping that we
can meet before you leave town

435
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,670
so I can explain the
confusion earlier today.

436
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,580
If you give me a chance, I'm
sure we can sort this all out.

437
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,860
Those crying the
loudest about privacy

438
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,730
are probably the ones
trying to hide something.

439
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,850
Finch.

440
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:57,430
They've hacked the car.

441
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,900
You can't fight the technology.

442
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:03,395
Someone is overriding

443
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:05,480
the vehicle's
electronic control unit.

444
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:07,130
You can't fight the technology.

445
00:27:07,165 --> 00:27:08,507
Mr. Reese, they can take control

446
00:27:08,542 --> 00:27:09,850
of his steering and throttle.

447
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:47,780
Bet you could use a lift.

448
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:10,500
Where am I?

449
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,165
Somewhere you won't be attacked

450
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,800
by the people who are
trying to kill you.

451
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,220
And you are?

452
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,180
Right now, your only option.

453
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:23,360
My car, what happened?

454
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:26,040
This electronic control unit,

455
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,365
it overrode your
car's internal E.C.U.,

456
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,940
allowing someone to control the
vehicle's functions remotely.

457
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,120
Someone who?

458
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:36,200
One of the members of that class
action suit brought against you.

459
00:28:36,235 --> 00:28:38,785
That suit? My lawyers settled that.

460
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:41,770
Not to everyone's
satisfaction, it would seem.

461
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,100
That's interesting.

462
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:46,330
What?

463
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,820
Chloe Harper, the young
woman killed by her stalker.

464
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:52,300
Her mother was lead plaintiff, but
there was no mention of her father.

465
00:28:52,335 --> 00:28:53,200
I just looked him up.

466
00:28:53,235 --> 00:28:54,870
Stu Sommers.

467
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:57,695
Different last name
than Chloe's--divorced?

468
00:28:57,730 --> 00:29:00,000
I remember that man
from your building.

469
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,590
He was posing as a janitor.

470
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:07,690
Yeah, Carl, hasn't
been around that long.

471
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,605
Because until three
months ago, he worked

472
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,835
as an electrical engineer
at an aerospace firm.

473
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:15,030
With a pedigree like that,
he would have the skills

474
00:29:15,065 --> 00:29:18,620
to design these
sophisticated attacks.

475
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,390
We need to find him.

476
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:23,910
He must be staying
somewhere in the city.

477
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:28,010
His personnel file, it would
have to have an address.

478
00:29:28,045 --> 00:29:29,300
I can call tomorrow morning.

479
00:29:29,335 --> 00:29:31,130
Not necessary.

480
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,290
Are you hacking my
building's servers?

481
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:41,280
Do you mind?

482
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:48,580
Carl Miller, 162 Willow
Street, apartment 4, Brooklyn.

483
00:29:48,615 --> 00:29:50,190
He'll either be there or
he'll be at Life Trace,

484
00:29:50,225 --> 00:29:51,865
where he has access
to the computers.

485
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:54,690
Planning his next
attack. I'll check it out.

486
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:56,170
I'll hit the apartment.

487
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:03,180
Perhaps you should
rest, Mr. Kruger.

488
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:05,160
You've had quite a day.

489
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:24,450
Got anything to eat around here?

490
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:28,350
Just sencha green tea and
a box of doggie treats.

491
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,000
I don't suppose what
you're working on

492
00:30:32,035 --> 00:30:33,355
over there concerns me.

493
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:35,075
I'm trying to
triangulate the location

494
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:36,760
of the call you
received in the elevator.

495
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,500
Did you recognize
anything about the caller?

496
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:42,170
No, nothing.

497
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,160
I'd prefer you didn't do that.

498
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:56,270
I'd prefer you mind
your own business.

499
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,630
That's a tad ironic, coming
from a man of your profession.

500
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:02,280
- Meaning what?
- Meaning your business

501
00:31:02,315 --> 00:31:04,350
is minding everyone
else's business.

502
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:08,540
I do what I do to simplify and
improve other people's lives.

503
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:09,755
What is it that you do?

504
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:12,530
We help people out of
difficult situations,

505
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:14,500
even situations of
their own design.

506
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:18,580
So it's my fault that some
wacko's trying to kill me?

507
00:31:18,615 --> 00:31:20,580
The man lost his
daughter, Mr. Kruger,

508
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:23,300
to a stalker who was
aided by your service.

509
00:31:23,335 --> 00:31:24,805
You feel no accountability?

510
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:28,325
I'm part of a $300
billion-a-year industry.

511
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:31,000
Information abuses are
unfortunate, but they happen.

512
00:31:31,035 --> 00:31:32,350
- can't be helped.
- Oh, they can,

513
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:35,320
but only if the people who
have access to the information

514
00:31:35,355 --> 00:31:36,760
are as interested in protecting it

515
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:38,750
as they are in profiting from it.

516
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:44,670
I was just checking to
see if my wife had called.

517
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,340
I want to make sure she was okay.

518
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:49,260
Mr. Kruger, I didn't
want you using the phone

519
00:31:49,295 --> 00:31:50,875
because it might not be safe,

520
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:52,500
but if you must
check your messages,

521
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:55,920
We can go through your
phone carrier's web portal.

522
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,590
Need my password?

523
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:00,990
You have a message.

524
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,965
Mr. Kruger, Pete Collier.

525
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,740
I spoke with my
colleagues and they agreed

526
00:32:04,775 --> 00:32:06,085
we should all sit down again.

527
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,495
If you could meet us
at the Mayfield at 9:30,

528
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:10,590
that should give us enough
time before our flight.

529
00:32:10,625 --> 00:32:12,405
We'll meet you in
the east dining room.

530
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,840
Yes, yes! If I leave
now, I can still make it.

531
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:16,200
And what about your wife?

532
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:18,340
I'll call her on the way.

533
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:20,450
Mr. Kruger, wait.

534
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:23,110
The message, it's
not labeled as "New".

535
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:26,140
Someone else must have
listened to it first.

536
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,570
Who?

537
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:29,585
Sommers!

538
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:31,240
And if he's listened to it, he'll
be waiting for you at the hotel.

539
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,975
It's too dangerous.

540
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:35,820
I don't care, there's too
much riding on this deal.

541
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,930
All right, I'll
contact my associates,

542
00:32:39,965 --> 00:32:41,600
Then have them meet
us at the hotel.

543
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:02,280
Okay, okay, Bear.

544
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:03,820
Goodness.

545
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,520
Finch.

546
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:27,110
Mr. Reese... Kruger's gone.

547
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:29,740
I made the mistake of
turning my back on him.

548
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:30,900
Are you all right?

549
00:33:30,935 --> 00:33:31,910
I will be.

550
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:39,080
It would appear that
Bear slowed Kruger down.

551
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:41,410
He's making his way
to the Mayfield Hotel

552
00:33:41,445 --> 00:33:43,430
to take a meeting with
the Riverton people.

553
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:46,260
I believe that Sommers
knows that as well.

554
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:48,090
I'm at his locker now.

555
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,115
He's been stalking Kruger,

556
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:58,030
just like his own
daughter was stalked.

557
00:33:58,065 --> 00:33:59,430
And ultimately killed.

558
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:02,020
I'll get over to the Mayfield.

559
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:06,890
Something else, Mr. Reese.

560
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:10,920
Kruger's not only
a potential victim,

561
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,890
he may also now be a perpetrator.

562
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:18,295
I cannot believe this is happening!

563
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:20,530
Someone is screwing with
me. Can't you see that?

564
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,760
I'm gonna fix this.

565
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:37,340
Looking for someone? Easy.

566
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,330
I won't miss at this range.

567
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,480
So what was the plan?

568
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:46,790
Were you gonna take me out
before or after my meeting?

569
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,910
I hadn't decided yet.

570
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,220
You know, you've caused me

571
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,060
a great deal of pain and
suffering, Mr. Sommers.

572
00:34:55,095 --> 00:34:56,400
That was the point.

573
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:01,320
Now, you're gonna help
me get it all back.

574
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,720
Mr. Kruger, you got my message.

575
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:13,410
What...happened to you?

576
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:17,860
You know, I'm...
really glad you asked.

577
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:19,630
Where's the rest of your team?

578
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:22,820
Unfortunately, they had
to catch an earlier flight.

579
00:35:22,855 --> 00:35:24,090
They send their regrets.

580
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,570
Hello.

581
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:28,575
Yeah. This is Mr. Sommers.

582
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:31,470
Look, I thought we were
gonna discuss our deal.

583
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:35,060
Yes, well, shortly
after I called you.

584
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:38,525
We attempted to revisit
the issue with our CEO,

585
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,590
but we couldn't get him
to reconsider his decision.

586
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,625
What?

587
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,040
I'm sorry, I thought
a face-to-face

588
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:46,170
would be better than
another phone call.

589
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,440
No.

590
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:50,410
- Excuse me?
- No!

591
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,750
You have no idea what I've
been through to get here!

592
00:35:54,785 --> 00:35:56,340
Mr. Kruger, why do you have a gun?

593
00:35:56,360 --> 00:36:00,890
Because this man humiliated
me, stole from me,

594
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,600
and even tried to kill me.

595
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:06,940
It was his twisted little game
that made our deal fall apart.

596
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:09,610
- Tell him.
- Okay, just, let's put down the gun.

597
00:36:09,645 --> 00:36:10,680
I said tell him!

598
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,270
Don't do it, Mr. Sommers.

599
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:20,530
Who are you?

600
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:23,970
Someone who knows
what this is about.

601
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:28,380
Chloe.

602
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:33,080
Then you know he killed her,

603
00:36:33,115 --> 00:36:34,852
and something had to be done.

604
00:36:34,887 --> 00:36:36,590
I never touched your daughter.

605
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:39,170
You may not have put your hands
on her like that monster did,

606
00:36:39,205 --> 00:36:41,330
but you're just as guilty.

607
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:43,160
I didn't do anything!

608
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:44,240
Exactly.

609
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:49,100
See, her ex-boyfriend
found her three times--

610
00:36:49,135 --> 00:36:51,790
three times, using your Life Trace.

611
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:54,360
And every time he found her,

612
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:57,630
we asked the company to
take her information down,

613
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,060
and they didn't do it,

614
00:37:00,095 --> 00:37:01,920
and so he found her again,

615
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:06,110
and again, until the last
time when he killed her.

616
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:12,570
All because you and your
company didn't do anything.

617
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:19,420
I didn't know.

618
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:23,590
I'm sorry.

619
00:37:23,625 --> 00:37:24,690
Yeah?

620
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:27,990
Sorry isn't good enough.

621
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,620
Listen to me, Stu.

622
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,900
You do this, and your life...

623
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,310
it's over.

624
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:36,850
It's already over.

625
00:37:36,885 --> 00:37:37,900
Stu...

626
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:41,680
this isn't the way to honor
your daughter's memory.

627
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:45,080
Think about it. What
would Chloe want?

628
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:07,140
You did the right
thing, for both of you.

629
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,960
Mr. Reese, I triangulated the call

630
00:38:10,995 --> 00:38:12,902
that Kruger received
in the elevator.

631
00:38:12,937 --> 00:38:14,810
It's now coming from
inside the Mayfield.

632
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:18,990
Mr. Reese?

633
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:23,975
You were right.
Something had to be done,

634
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:26,480
Which is why we reached
out to you, Mr. Sommers.

635
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:32,165
You--you did it. You
sent me the package.

636
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:37,110
We sent you the means to exact
justice for your daughter,

637
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:40,370
and you had the courage to act.

638
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:45,670
Unfortunately, the car
crash wasn't successful...

639
00:38:45,705 --> 00:38:47,945
Requiring this improvisation,

640
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:50,150
but everything
worked out in the end.

641
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,510
You should go now, Mr. Sommers.

642
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,490
I think you understand now.

643
00:39:06,525 --> 00:39:07,900
Understand what?

644
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:14,760
What is lost when your
privacy's stripped away.

645
00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:19,940
Your identity, your job,

646
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:21,640
your family,

647
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,590
security, everything.

648
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:28,630
You...

649
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:31,270
And thousands more just like me.

650
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:35,500
People who have chosen
action over apathy,

651
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:38,800
to take back what men like you

652
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:42,630
and the government have stolen.

653
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:49,280
This wasn't a game, Mr. Kruger,

654
00:39:49,315 --> 00:39:49,980
this was a lesson,

655
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:51,560
the first.

656
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:55,220
We were just gonna
scare you, but...

657
00:39:57,370 --> 00:39:59,570
that wouldn't change
anything, would it?

658
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:10,375
Finch.

659
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:11,695
John, are you shot?

660
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:15,480
My vest caught it.
Think my rib's broken.

661
00:40:15,515 --> 00:40:16,530
And Kruger?

662
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:21,170
He's dead, Finch.

663
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:24,240
I got him.

664
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,610
Can you walk?

665
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,780
I need to get to Collier.

666
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:31,390
We've got to get you out of here.

667
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:35,140
She's right, Mr.
Reese. Another time.

668
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:52,430
Back for more?

669
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:54,890
I need to say something.

670
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:57,500
Can it wait until
after you buy me coffee?

671
00:40:58,610 --> 00:41:01,560
I know you had to take a
partner to get back on days,

672
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:03,520
but did you know
that two other rookies

673
00:41:03,555 --> 00:41:05,190
were supposed to be
in this seat before me?

674
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:07,345
And both requested
to be reassigned.

675
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:09,845
If you want another
F.T.O., just say the word.

676
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,890
No, that's the point, I
didn't ask to be reassigned,

677
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:15,060
because I chose you.

678
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:17,750
Chose me? Why?

679
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:21,250
In the academy, I heard about you.

680
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,945
Your work with the
homicide task force

681
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,890
and how you took down
those corrupt cops.

682
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:27,840
I thought,

683
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:29,280
"Someday, that's
what I want to do."

684
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:32,050
That's why I jumped at the
chance to train under you.

685
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:35,690
But I don't get the sense
that you want to train anybody,

686
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:38,110
and if that's the case,

687
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:41,060
then I'd prefer it if
you just cut me loose.

688
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:48,120
3-Adam-10, we got a report of
a 10-53 near Morris and 149th.

689
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:00,000
Roger, dispatch.
3-adam-10 responding.

690
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,120
I made a call to
Riverton's home office.

691
00:42:16,155 --> 00:42:18,890
Seems Collier, no doubt an alias,

692
00:42:18,925 --> 00:42:20,670
has not returned to work.

693
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:22,495
And I don't think he will.

694
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:26,070
He started four months ago
as V.P. of customer analytics,

695
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:28,340
a position that allowed him
to get close enough to Kruger

696
00:42:28,375 --> 00:42:31,170
so that he could both
witness and participate

697
00:42:31,205 --> 00:42:33,430
in the dismantling of his life.

698
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:36,290
He told Kruger there
were others like him.

699
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:38,145
Yes, and I'm inclined
to believe him.

700
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,990
I discovered that
the anonymous packages

701
00:42:40,025 --> 00:42:42,012
sent to Mr. Sommers and the others

702
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:44,000
came through
mail-processing centers

703
00:42:44,035 --> 00:42:45,507
scattered all over the country.

704
00:42:45,542 --> 00:42:46,945
Could've saved on the postage

705
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:48,810
and just shot him when
they had the chance.

706
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:53,550
I'm just saying it
was an elaborate plan.

707
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:55,540
It wasn't just
about killing Kruger.

708
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:59,430
It was about giving the people
he hurt a chance at retribution.

709
00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:03,140
And also putting an
ideology into action.

710
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:06,740
Collier referred to Kruger's
murder as "A lesson".

711
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:08,110
The first.

712
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,120
I fear that whatever
his organization's

713
00:43:12,155 --> 00:43:13,690
ultimate goals may be,

714
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:16,700
this could be just the beginning.
